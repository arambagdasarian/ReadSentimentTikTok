When I was younger and I was dating and I wasn't very confident I kind of like Would go out with anybody and not with anybody. I had standards, but like I would go with any type of person for the most part and Kind of just let them treat me however they wanted to treat me and I didn't really demand respect and I didn't really know what I wanted And I didn't know how to communicate and I didn't understand my feelings and so I mean I was able to Day like I handful of people but at the same time They weren't like good relationships. I wasn't very comfortable I felt very confused all the time and now as an almost 27 year old who's been Single for a while and like has dealt with a couple of complicated relationships and is learned How to communicate through them. I feel like my standards are like Way up here and that doesn't vote well for like connecting specifically connecting to to men unfortunately And I think it's because I like one refused to be strong along like the second that you show that maybe you're not quite interested in me like That's it. We're done. You know like I'm not into playing games I'm a very patient person but like not when it impacts my quality of life and and so I feel like I'm really really picky and that way I also just don't have patients for People who need to be taught how to communicate or need to be taught how to feel their feelings I think that I like take on a bit of a therapeutic role in a lot of relationships and I just don't want that in a romantic relationship Like I would like to find somebody who's kind of on a similar playing field to me and that's just like In reality like not really Possible and another thing I've really had to reckon with that we talked about this morning is that like I At this point because I'm so comfortable with myself and I love myself so much I have a good time with almost anybody and so when I meet a new person And we're like going on a date and we're having like banter and stuff I'm having a good time because I know how to ask good questions. I'm engaging. I'm funny like You know, it's just like I show up authentically and I love myself for that and so I have to kind of go back and Reflect afterwards and be like did I have fun because I really enjoyed this person or did I have fun because I Enjoy myself and I have fun with myself because like I could spend all day with myself and just yeah, but way and and have so much fun So that's also been interesting. I feel like it just like slims out The dating pool and granted I have not done much dating like at all Racantly like at all at all, but Thinking about it definitely makes me nervous now because I am very sure of myself and I feel like that can be an Intimidating way to show up In front of people who are not sure of themselves or who are insecure So we'll see where that goes. I don't intend on like updating you guys on my dating life I just haven't thinking about this and I feel like it's relevant information so I wanted to share it with you But yeah, that's how I feel about dating right now","A woman reflects on how her personal growth, increased self-awareness, and higher standards have paradoxically made dating more challenging in her late 20s.","A young woman with blonde hair, wearing a cozy grey knit cardigan and dark pants, speaks directly to the camera while sitting in a room illuminated by a warm, orange-red light.
